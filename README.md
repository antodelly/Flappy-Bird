# Flappy-Bird - My first python project with pygame
I'm a student who are learning this beautifull lenguage like Python, simply and compleate (for now), and I wanted to deepen with a project such language, thus also testing my knowledge on the subject and programming.
I thought of creating a repository here so that anyone can help me in the provision and a more correct implementation of my project, hoping not to make programming mistakes xD
Thank you for reading :D
